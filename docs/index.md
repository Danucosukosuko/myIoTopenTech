The main aims of my IoT open Tech are:

* Lower the barrier to IoT technologies, even for non-techies.
* Protect data privacy, and raise awareness of its importance. Your data is your data.
* Encourage the cooperative deployment of community IoT networks and tools.

#Features

* Easy: my IoT open Tech offers templates for diverse device types (see supported devices), and even some of them can be directly provisioned upon receiving its first telemetry.
