# my IoT legram

my IoT legram is a Telegram bot that acts as an intermediary between my IoT open Tech and the user, offering and easy and convenient access to her devices.

Currently only a few of the my IoT open Tech supported device types are available in my IoT legram (see [supported device/asset types table](https://iotopentech.github.io/myIoTopenTech/supported-devices.html)), but anyone can add more types to our repository using the developer's documentation.

Each device can be integrated with my IoT legram in 2 modes:

* **Administrator**: This mode offers full control of the device; in other words: the user can see its telemetries, configure its functional parameters, and manage its alarms.
* **Observer**: This mode allows the user to see all the device's data, including telemetries, functional parameters and alarms, but not to change them.
